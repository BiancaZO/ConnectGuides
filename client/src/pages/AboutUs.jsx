    <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-4">
      ConnectGuides was born out of a passion for travel and a deep appreciation for local cultures. We noticed that while there are countless travel resources available, finding reliable and knowledgeable local guides was still a challenge for many travelers. At the same time, many local guides struggled to reach potential clients. This inspired us to create a platform that would address these challenges and enhance the travel experience.

    <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-700 mb-4">Safety and Security</h2>
    <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-4">
      Your safety is our top priority. We require all guides to present a valid police report as part of their application process. This helps us ensure that our clients are in safe hands. We also encourage our clients to verify the credentials of their guides and report any suspicious activity to us immediately.

    <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-700 mb-4">Who Can Be a Guide</h2>
    <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-4">
      To become a guide with ConnectGuides, individuals must comply with the local regulations and rules applicable in their country or location. It is the responsibility of the guide to ensure they meet these requirements. We do not support or endorse any illegal activity, and guides must adhere to all relevant local laws.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-700 mb-4">Personal Service</h2>
    <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-4">
